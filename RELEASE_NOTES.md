# Broker 2.0 - Development History & Release Notes

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-29
### Fixed — `trans_type` case mismatch (Dividends & P&L were empty)
- Production data stores `trans_type` in UPPERCASE (`DIVIDEND`, `BUY`, `SELL`),
  but the API filtered Title-case literals (`'Dividend'`, `'Buy'`, `'Sell'`) →
  every filtered query returned 0 rows.
- `api-dividends.php`: filter via `UPPER(trans_type) IN (...)`; normalize the
  `type` returned to the frontend to canonical Title-case.
- `api-pnl.php`: match `UPPER(trans_type)` for Buy/Sell.
- Verified against the live DB: 428 dividends and 47 sales now visible (was 0).
- Follow-up (not yet done): `ajax-check-missing-prices.php` and several legacy
  flat-PHP files (`div.php`, `bal.php`, `sal.php`) still use case-sensitive
  filters; the legacy ones query a non-existent `broker_trans` and are dead.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-29 (b)
### Fixed — legacy endpoints couldn't connect on Railway (hardcoded MySQL)
- Several frontend-wired endpoints built a hardcoded `new PDO("mysql:...")` and
  relied on a non-existent `api/db.php` → broken on Railway PostgreSQL.
- `ajax-get-chart-data.php`: use `get_pdo()`; fix column `date` → `history_date`
  (verified: returns 502 rows for a real ticker).
- `api-delete-transactions.php`: use `get_pdo()`; fix ticker filter `id` → `ticker`.
- Known remaining: `ajax-update-prices` (id/ticker drift), `api-comments` /
  `ajax-get-user` / `api-dev-history` target tables that don't exist in the
  production schema (`changerequest_*`, `development_history`) — needs schema
  decision before fixing. ~23 dead `broker_*` legacy files pending cleanup.

## [v2.1.0] - 2026-03-31
### Modernization & Railway Deployment
- **Core Refactoring**: Completely overhauled the backend to support PostgreSQL and environment-based configuration via `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Infrastructure**: Added `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` for containerized deployment.
- **Directory Structure**: 
  - Backend moved to `/api/`
  - Frontend moved to `/frontend/` (React/Vite)
- **Database Architecture**:
  - Implemented `api/config.php` as a central DB adapter.
  - Added `api/init_broker.php` for easy schema initialization on new environments.
  - Switched from MySQL-specific syntax to cross-driver PDO.
- **Frontend Updates**:
  - Updated API integration to use the new `/api/` prefix.
  - Implemented `AuthContext` and `TranslationContext` with PostgreSQL support.
- **Initialization**: Created a robust setup script that creates necessary tables and a default admin user.

## [v2.0.0] - Legacy Implementation
- Original implementation with MySQL on Wedos.
- Built using PHP 7.4 and React (legacy build).
- Integrated with ČNB for currency rates.
- Basic portfolio and transaction tracking.
